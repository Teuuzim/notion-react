              <strong>Utility-First Approach:</strong> By focusing on utility
              classes, Tailwind CSS encourages a consistent design system. This
              approach helps in maintaining a clean and readable codebase where
              styles are applied directly in the HTML, reducing the need for
              separate CSS files.

              <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Tailwind CSS provides built-in

              at different screen sizes using intuitive class names like{" "}

              <strong>Performance Optimized:</strong> Tailwind CSS includes a
              feature called "purging" that removes unused CSS classes from your
              production build, resulting in significantly smaller file sizes
              and faster load times.

              <strong>Consistent Styling:</strong> The utility-first approach
              promotes consistent styling across your project. Instead of
              reusing specific styles or components, you apply the same
              utilities wherever needed, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
